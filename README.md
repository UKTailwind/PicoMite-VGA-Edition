# PicoMite-VGA-Edition

PicoMiteVGA V5.09.00b0
ALL SOURCE FILES NOW IN THE PICOMITE REPOSITORY

Just substitute the cmake file to build this variant

Special thanks to Miroslav Nemecek for the code used as the basis of the 320x240 16colour and 640x480 monochrome VGA drivers. This runs exclusively on the second processor and has little of no impact on MMbasic performance.

Files are included for two designs of PCB specifically designed for this software. The .eprj files are the EasyEDA design files.
V1.0 uses a RLC filter for PWM audio. V1.1 uses a MCP4822 DAC for audio. The BOM include all parts to make the PCBs and are compatible with JLC. To reduce cost you can omit components (e.g. Header pins, RTC clock chip, PS2 section) as required
